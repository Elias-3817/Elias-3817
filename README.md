### ✌🏽👋🏽 About Me

I am a business-impact-focused BI Analyst with a relentless drive to solve high-leverage problems. My core mission is to empower businesses, particularly Kenyan SMEs, by transforming their raw financial data (like M-Pesa statements) from a source of confusion into a clear roadmap for growth.

-   🧠 **I Think In Systems:** I specialize in building end-to-end data pipelines that are robust, automated, and designed for clarity.
-   💡 **I Speak Business:** My technical skills serve one purpose: to answer critical business questions, reduce financial leaks, and identify revenue opportunities.
-   🎯 **I Focus on Signal:** I operate with a craftsman's precision, cutting through the noise to deliver insights that matter.
