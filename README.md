# Elias Gichuru | Business Intelligence Developer

Turning messy financial data into profit-driving dashboards, monitoring systems, and decision-making tools for African businesses.

I build systems that do three things reliably:
1. Reveal where money is leaking.
2. Show where growth is hiding.
3. Help founders and operators make better decisions faster.
